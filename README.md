## Project Status

GSConnect is now under the GitHub organisation [GSConnect][gsconnect-org].

Please note, this project has migrated from a developer-driven model to a
community-driven model. This means that GSConnect does not have dedicated
developers working on new features or bug fixes. Instead, the project relies on
contributions from its users and distributions that choose to package it.

If you would like to take a more active role in the development and maintenance
of GSConnect, you can start by [triaging new issues][issues],
[fixing confirmed issues][help-wanted] and [reviewing contributions][needs-review].
If you need additional permissions, you may request them from one of the
[current maintainers][people].

## Nightly Builds

For early updaters of GNOME Shell and those that wish to test the upcoming version
of GSConnect, there are automated builds available for [download][nightly-build].
See [Installing from Nightly Build][nightly-install] for installation instructions.
