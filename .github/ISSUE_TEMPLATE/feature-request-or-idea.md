#### Please delete this line and everything below before submitting your request

GSConnect works in concert with the [KDE Connect][1] app on paired Android devices. Communication between GSConnect and the device is controlled by **KDE Connect**, _not_ GSConnect.

Any request that would require features not supported in KDE Connect, or would require GSConnect to deviate from the KDE Connect protocols, cannot be implemented. Any such requests should be made to the KDE Connect project. The requested functionality can only be implemented in GSConnect after support is added to KDE Connect.
