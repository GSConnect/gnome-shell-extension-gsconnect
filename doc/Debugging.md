### General Debugging

Sometimes it may be necessary to access debug messages to help solve an issue. The easiest way is to open the Debugger and click the terminal button:

![...][preferences-debugger]

**Warning**

Debug messages may contain sensitive information and will appear in your log. Remember to turn of debug logging when finished.
